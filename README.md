## Executive Summary
Emasomo is playing a big role in data and information sharing
especially at this time of speaking (Covid19 Era). Among others, it is a medium
for assignments and cats completion. Every CUK student has an emasomo
account of which he or she has a unique username and a password
for. There would not be a need of login credentials if emasomo is
not implementing confidentiality.
What if people have each others credentials and anyone can be
anybody else? This will not be privacy.
Therefore here in this context am discussing my findings on
disclosing the login credentials for emasomo.

## Breakdown
As I may say among the latest upgrades to the CUK emasomo website
was generation of new usernames and passwords. Each credential
was emailed to its respective student email account.
From the email it was deterministic that this credentials were
computer-generated because it is quite a huge task to be done
manually. 
If it is a computer that generates the credentials then it must
be following a certain pattern under circumstances in which it is
programmed.
Below were my personal computer-generated credentials:
username: simondou
password: SimonDou@2022

My full name as it appear in emasomo is Simon Douglas.
